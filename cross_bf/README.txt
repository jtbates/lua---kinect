 1- How to install
###################

a) Requirements
---------------

This code has been made and tested under Linux. It should work as well
under Windows.


b) Compiling
------------

Running 'make' should compile everything out of the box.









 2- How to use
###############

On the command line, type:
./cross_bilateral_filter input.ppm edge.ppm output.ppm 16.0 0.1

The parameters are:

- 'input.ppm': It is an image file in the PPM format. 'convert' from
the ImageMagick package makes it easy to produce such files.

- 'edge.ppm': It is an image file in the PPM format. 'convert' from
the ImageMagick package makes it easy to produce such files. The input
intensities will be smoothed according to the edge intensities. Both
images must have the same size.

- 'output.ppm': It is the image that will be created. The file format
is PPM. Software such as Photoshop, Gimp, and xv can read this format.

- 16.0: The 1st number is the space sigma in pixels.

- 0.1: The 2nd number is the range sigma. The intensity is considered
in the [0:1] range.










 3- The algorithm
##################

Here is the pseudo-code for the algorithm:
(a) load a PPM image
(b) compute gray levels
(c) apply the fast cross bilateral filter
(d) save the result image










 4- The code
#############

The code is in C++.

The algorithm described above is in 'truncated_bilateral_bf.cc'. This
is the file that you may want to edit. The code follows the
description exactly. Comments precede each part. Variable names are
long and self-explanatory.

You should not need to edit the other files. But in case you want to,
here is a short description of each of them.


In the 'include' directory:
---------------------------

- array.h: Classes for 2D and 3D arrays of values.

- array_n.h: Class for nD arrays of values.

- fast_lbf.h: Provides a fast color bilateral filter.

- math_tools.h: Several useful simple functions.

- mixed_vector.h: Provide a class to extend vectors. Useful to add a
  homongeneous coordinate.

- msg_stream.h: C++ streams for warnings and errors.





5- Improving performances
#########################

Compiler optimizations can speed up the process a lot. However, the
provided makefile does not use any optimization to maximize the
chances of successful compilation. For instance, with 'gcc' you may
try options such as '-O3' and '-march=pentium4'.
